# About this project

micro:bit pinout is a detailed, interactive guide to the GPIO pins on your BBC micro:bit, and the pins that various micro:bit add-ons use.

Find out if two add-ons will work together, or what pins you have available when using a particular add-on.

# Building

At the moment you can build with `./build.py > index.html`, however this is expected to change once additional pages for boards and other features are added.

# Support this project

micro:bit pinout is a passion project put together in my free time, leverging my first-hand knowledge of designing, manufacturing and supporting micro:bit add-ons.
